# ATUS: Select-Non-work-Activities-and-Weekly-Earnings
 
The American Time Use Survey is an annual survey conducted on a sample of individuals across the United States studying how individuals spent their time over the course of a day. Individual respondents were interviewed about what activities they did, during what times (rounded to 15 minute increments), at what locations, and in the presence of which individuals. The activities are subsequently encoded based on 3 separate tier codes for classification.

This project involves exploring the ATUS Data and predicting income based on how people spend non-work time. Non-work time was defined as "socializing, relaxing, and leisure" or as "sleeping" as reported in the ATUS dataset. This excludes things like exercise, household chores, and religious activities. The initial hypothesis was that there may be a connection between how someone spends this non-work time and their level of income. For example, perhaps if an individual spends a disproportionate amount of time watching TV during their non-work hours, they make less weekly earnings because theyâ€™re not building skills or maintaining their health.

Packages such as tidyverse and atus for exploring the ATUS data, data wrangling, data merging, regression modeling and analysis, exploratory data analysis, and summary tables.
