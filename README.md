# ATUS: Select-Non-work-Activities-and-Weekly-Earnings
 
The American Time Use Survey is an annual survey conducted on a sample of individuals across the United States studying how individuals spent their time over the course of a day. Individual respondents were interviewed about what activities they did, during what times (rounded to 15 minute increments), at what locations, and in the presence of which individuals. The activities are subsequently encoded based on 3 separate tier codes for classification.
